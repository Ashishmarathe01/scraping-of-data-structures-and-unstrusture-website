You can volunteer for the Mentorship Program and make a significant difference by just being present and taking an interest in the lives of these students. The long-term impact of such mentoring is invaluable; students who are mentored perform better in interviews, work better in teams and interact better in social situations.How can volunteers help?:The purpose of the mentorship call is to talk about general issues, challenges and life experiences. These mentorship sessions can make all the difference since most students from low-income backgrounds are often not acquainted with educated successful adults, who would take the time to guide and speak with them.Please note: The objective of the mentoring session is not to conduct career counselling, since mentees may not necessarily want to be in the same profession as the mentor. Further, FEA has a dedicated Career counselling and guidance team to address specific career-related questions.Things to keep in mind:FEA welcomes volunteers, whohave more than 2 years of work experience.are older than 25 years.are able to comfortably communicate in English since FEA tries to empower students to maintain an 'English only' environment in the class.Time commitment needed by the Volunteer:Mentors are expected to:conduct a total of 5 mentoring sessions in the form of a zoom call over a period of 3-5 months.ensure that each mentoring session is 90 minutes long.choose the frequency of these calls i.e. each call can be a minimum of 7 or a maximum of 28 days apart from the previous call.Meet the TeamStarted in 2010, FEA is a dynamic, non-governmental, non-religious, not-for-profit organization that provides young people with the skills and tools they need to break free from the cycle of poverty. FEA currently operates in over 11 cities across India and uses over 111 branches to provide supplemental training to over 30,000 young people between the age of 15 to 27 years, who have recently entered, or who are on the verge of entering, India’s workforce.
